				design is art applied to a problem, when you subject that art to guides, formulas, and overbearing systems it becomes stale, it looses it's artistic roots and becomes disconnected from the people it is meant to help.<br><br>with that in mind, this website was designed without a grid or system in mind, but instead was designed around a feel and with the consumers of the website in mind.<br><br>did you notice? was it obvious that the placement of objects was more intentional than snapping items to a grid. if not, go back and look at it again with guides enabled.<br><br>
