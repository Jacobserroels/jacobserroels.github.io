What is perfection? In a world of photoshop and a seemingly “perfect design.” people feel distant and separated from themselves, and the media they consume.
“I’m not perfect, I don’t have it all together” they say.
they continue,
“But everywhere I look I see perfect people, and perfect design.”
they ponder for a moment, “either there is something wrong with me,
or there is something wrong with the world.”
They make a decision, “I am wrong.”

Whether that be video, photo, design, or the like.

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY PAGE

What does perfectly imperfect mean?
Perfectly imperfect is the idea that feel is more important than “Perfect.” And while grids and other tools are important and have their place. I would argue that something with a little more grit and “Swing” to it is better in many cases.




FUNCTION
        Why: Why are we making this? Why are we doing it this way? Why aren't we doing something different? 
FORM
        What: What medium are we using? What is the competition doing? What can we do to replicate previous success?
FEEL
        How: How does this look? How does this feel? How does this meet our goals? How can we make it feel better?
