			perfection,<br> 
			What is perfection? In a world of photoshop and a seemingly “perfect design.” people feel distant and separated from themselves, and the media they consume<br>
			“I’m not perfect, I don’t have it all together” they say.<br>
			they continue,<br>
			“But everywhere I look I see perfect people, and perfect design.”<br>
			they ponder for a moment, “either there is something wrong with me,<br>
			or there is something wrong with the world.”<br>
			They make a decision, “I am wrong.” Yet are they?<br>
			I strive to make media that connects with people on more than just an aesthetic level.
			Whether that be video, photo, design, or the like.
			People want to feel represented with the things they consume.<br>
			So... partner with me in my journey to make perfectly imperfect things.<br><br>
